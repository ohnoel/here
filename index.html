    <h2>Names</h2>
    <hr>
    <body>
      i think in the beginning, it was our house. it was our house, with the big tree out front, the granite blocks, the shifty ones with ants running through them, they were the border between the lawn and the makeshift driveway, the cracked one that used to be a hockey rink each summer; it was our house, under the sun, under the shadow of the big tree, under the skyline ceiling
    </body>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <hr>

    <body>and then it was 138 horsham avenue and mum’s place, but there was also dad’s place on ranleigh forever away, he was forever away, mum’s car was the glue between he and re, but zak held my hand to walk to churchill public, cause it was also that, it was the field that forgot trees because the number of moth caterpillars was getting dangerous, my sneakers slid on puddles of larva corpses, i was a larva, and mum hired some chainsaws to cut down our tree
    </body>
    <h2>Geography</h2>
    <hr>
    <body>it was cummer valley middle, it was northview heights, it was the laughter echo concourse floor of the ago, i was oozing within myself, it was the pink-walled sewing lab of tmu before it was tmu, it was there where i pricked my finger and pricked my cocoon and i started slipping out, and the only thing i could do was to tense all my muscles and breathe in slow out slow so i could become a caterpillar again
    </body>
    <h2>Economy</h2>
    <hr>
    <body>but i was so slow now, and when it was chinatown and queen and spadina i never caught the streetcar in time, i was alway late to work when it was deserres, there were butterflies and moths all squished around me, a jar where i forgot to poke the holes, the beetles died there it was there, i was struggling, i took up too much space, i needed a cocoon one more time, so it was there i decided it would be halifax and i kissed my love goodbye and i kissed the real one too and it was under the stars and it was there in mum’s car again, but i was wretched in there, i was squirming under the seat belt, all the way to the atlantic
    </body>
    <h2>Demographics</h2>
    <hr>
    <body>it was my basement by the ocean, trapped under hurricane snow slush and smoking butts off the sidewalk ‘cause i had no money and they were wet so it was there i balanced them heated them on the radiator, and i’d walk to dal and i’d return them to the earth where i borrowed them and on spring garden and by the atlantic ocean oh god it was there every night at two in the morning, me and the atlantic and the creaking of the wood plank edge of canada, it was this, temporary, i was a timeshare stranger, it was not there, it was not inbetween the sky and the water
    </body>
    <h2>Culture</h2>
    <hr>
    <body>it was there where it was not time yet it was not yet time to build the cocoon so, then, it became toronto again, closed blinds on the apartment closed blinds over my mouth, to wrap myself with a new cocoon was to wrap myself in the web of the internet, years spooling, an old sewing machine that grandma left in the apartment, it was in the thread that became the binding of torn fabric, sloppy stitching over an heirloom cut, it was there i remembered i was chinese it was there i missed it and it was there i became muffled in webpages, myself, a time capsule
    </body>
    <h2>See also</h2>
    <hr>
    <body>it was there, half of me or more whatever measured on the scale in the metro, it was stuck online and lost to pupate, the other half, it was there, tears reflected the skyline, a sealing, an entrapment to the word, to there, of here, whatever here was supposed to be, it was me and it was time and it was the land and it was the digital land i was being fed, sprinkles made more addictive than any tobacco shavings burnt under the radiator, it was there i was me and it was here i am me and they are me and not me and we are all here whether it be there or then, i carry this, i carry knowing, i carry memoir, because here is all i’ll ever truly know.
